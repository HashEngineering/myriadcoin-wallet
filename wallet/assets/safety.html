		<ul>
			<li>
                Myriadcoins are stored on the device.
				<b>If you lose it, you'll lose your Myriadcoins.</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
				Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
				Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
			</li>
			<li>

				<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Myriadcoins to another wallet</b>.
				Remaining Myriadcoins will be lost.
			</li> 
			<li>
				<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
				If you send your Myriadcoins into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.

			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
				Do not root your device.
				Do only install apps you fully trust.
				Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
